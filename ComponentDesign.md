### Energy price modeling
1. What it does. This should be a high level description of the roles of the component.
2. Name. This should be the name that you use in the component's implementation (e.g., the name of a python class or function).
3. Inputs. Be specific about the data types. For DataFrames, specify the column names and the types of the column values.
4. Outputs. Same consideration as with inputs.
5. How it works (ideally with pseudo code).
