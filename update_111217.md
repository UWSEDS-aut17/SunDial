Update by Ryan on 11/12/17

Added utils.py and 2 .ipynb files

Start with Loading_Data_and_Defining_subtasks.ipynb

Description of files added:
Loading_Data_and_Defining_subtasks.ipynb:
Describes how to load all the data (from Google Drive)
Defines subtasks that we can start to divide and conquer
Gives some more clarity in objective and strategy

Downloading_Data.ipynb:
Describes how to download data from original sources
(for instance, if you start to work on a subtask and need to procure
additional data)

utils.py
this is just my solution to HW3, that I used to download data files.
We can add to this other utils functions as needed
