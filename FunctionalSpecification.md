# Project functional specification

### Problem Statement: Optimize user's cost savings by intelligently utilizing solar and battery assets.

### User profile:
- Detailed knowledge about different types of solar and battery assets in use.
- Should have enough understanding about the solar/battery assets being used by the user.
- Understand the high-level concepts that were involved in building the optimization models.
- Should be able to evaluate the results from the model.
- General knowledge in navigating a webpage.
- What else does the user need to know?

### Elements
- What solar/battery feartures would be most responsible for optimizing costs?
- What other elements (for eg. weather) are responsible for the costs?
- See Flowchart schematic for our workflow (Model_flowchart_outline.tif)
- The above tasks can be implemented in parellel and get combined

### Use Cases
- TODO
