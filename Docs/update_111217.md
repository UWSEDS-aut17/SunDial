Update by Ryan on 11/12/17

Added utils.py and 2 .ipynb files

Start with Loading_Data_and_Defining_subtasks.ipynb

I think much of what is in this notebook satisfies the HW6:Component Design
(we can track the subtasks to components)

Description of files added:
Loading_Data_and_Defining_subtasks.ipynb:
Describes how to load all the data (from Google Drive)
Defines subtasks that we can start to divide and conquer
Gives some more clarity in objective and strategy
Think about which subtask you would most like to work on

Downloading_Data.ipynb:
Describes how to download data from original sources
(for instance, if you start to work on a subtask and need to procure
additional data)

utils.py
this is just my solution to HW3, that I used to download data files.
We can add to this other utils functions as needed
