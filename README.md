PROBLEM STATEMENT / SUMMARY
With the costs of solar cells and batteries continuing to decline, solar cell-battery combination systems have become viable options to save on electricity costs while offseting carbon emisions. However, with electricity demand, grid ulility cost, and available sunlight all changing dynamically, the most profitible strategy to utilize generated electricity and meet required electicity demand with such a system is not intuitive. We aim to develop machine learning models based on weather, utility, and battery/solar data to predict the most profitable strategy to operate a solar+battery system in a dynamic environment. We indend our platform to be widely applicible accross scales ("single family home" -> "large data center" -> "county-wide electricity network") and hope to produce a general economic viablity assessment of such solar+battery installations in different regions across the US.
